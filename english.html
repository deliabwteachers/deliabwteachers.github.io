      <h4>Mr. Chan Pak Kan</h4>

In terms of curriculum design, course content and pedagogy, Mr. Chan believes students are the center and that their varied needs and abilities should be well catered for. Quoting from Rabi Hanina: "I have learned much from my teachers, more from my colleagues, and most from my students.", he considers students to be the main source of inspiration for his teaching and they have so much more to learn from. </p>

As an assistant form mistress (S.3) and a member of the school’s discipline committee, she helps to guide and monitor students to meet higher standards of academic success, discipline and cooperation amongst one another. Ms. Gurwinder truly believes that no child should be left behind and strives to incorporate that ideology in the execution of all her duties as a teacher, and an alumna, at Broadway. </p>
