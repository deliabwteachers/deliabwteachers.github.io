      <h4> Mr. Wan, Ho Yueng </h4>
      <p> After I graduated from the university, I started my teaching career immediately in a local secondary school. However, after few years of teaching, I wanted to enrich my life experience so I quit my teaching job and started to work in the commercial field. Also, I found that I love travelling so much so I spent another two and a half years for travelling around the world to fulfil my dream. After travelling to around 60 countries in Asia, Europe and the Middle East, I am so satisfied with what I did in the previous years. Now, I am teaching in Broadway and I enjoy meeting people from different cultural background.</p>

      <p>Ms Tahira graduated from Broadway. She studied at The University of Hong Kong majoring in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. She teaches Mathematics and Biology. Her passion for teaching started when she used to come to Broadway to assist the students in Mathematics tutorials. It gave her a sense of accomplishment whenever the students were able to grasp a concept with her help. Students often find subjects like Mathematics and Science very challenging and give up easily. She hopes to motivate the students to not give up and do their best in the face of challenges.

      <p>Since studying Biology from High School and HKUST, Ms. Fu found that life is interesting and gain large sense of successfulness when she can solve the question with what she learnt. And she hopes that her students can feel the same ways. Biology is a study of life, Education is an influence of life. When these two come together, it is challenging but fruitful to her.  When her students fall and stand right back up again, she feels proud of them to be willing to work hard and finally have improvement.
