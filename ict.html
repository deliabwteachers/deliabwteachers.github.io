      <h4>Mr. Man, Chun Him </h4>
      <p>Mr. Man has been serving at Delia since September, 2022 and he teaches Computer Literacy of lower forms. Mr. Man believes that IT can change our life as working time will be shortened and mistakes can be avoided. Students will get benefits if IT knowledge and skills are equipped in the early stage in secondary school. As programming language seems to be everyone's second language in the coming future, Mr. Man hopes his students learn coding through hands-on experiences such as creating mobile apps and hardware controlling so that they will take advantages of the AI age.
