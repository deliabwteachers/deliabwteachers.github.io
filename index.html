      <h4> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Assistant School Principal &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Kot, Kwok Chio</h4>
      <p>Mr. Kot has been serving at Delia for almost 30 years and he is / was in charge of various departments such as Student Guidance, SEN (Students with Special Education Needs), Student Discipline, Extra-Curricular Activities, Careers and Studies, Alumni Association, Parents-Teachers Association, Life-Wide-Learning Activities, School Ceremonies and Inter-school Events as well. Mr. Kot believes that school education is to provide a safe, fair and scaffolded learning environment, filled with opportunities to facilitate students to learn knowledge, skills, experience, values, and attitudes as well.  Quality teaching is the most important factor for the success of education. Mr. Kot hopes his students can “strive for advancement despite adversity”. They may not be the best but they can improve!

      <h4> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; School Discipline Master &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Wong, Chau Wai</h4>
      <p>As the Discipline Master in school more than 20 years, lots of impressive and amazing working experience throughout my life. First of all, earning the respect and caring from many students and their families which makes me feel proud to become one of the staffs in Broadway. Moreover, every single communication or contact with the students and their parent lead me to have better and deeper understanding the ethnic minority people lifestyle, customs, difficulties in their daily life and their view on their future prospect in HK. No matter how I myself should be the lucky guy to compare other teachers in HK who are not in Broadway. Thanks for everyone who support me throughout my career in Broadway. Promise to all you that I am doing my best to work on it.</p>
