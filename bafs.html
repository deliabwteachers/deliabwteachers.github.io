      <h4>Ms. Rozwille, Zahoor</h4>
      <p>Towards the end of her undergraduate studies, Miss Rozwille contemplated on which job she could make an impact and found herself back at her alma mater.  Already in her 5th year of teaching, not a week goes by where she does not find herself smiling because of the studentsâ€™ sense of humour or the warmth she feels when she steps into her homeroom. While proper classroom management and discipline is important while she teaches, Miss Rozwille is a strong believer of maintaining mutual respect and connecting with her students. To this day, Miss Rozwille is grateful for the teachers who made an impact on her, and she hopes to make the same impact on her students.
