      <h4>Mr. Yu, Kin Fu</h4>
      <p>Mr. Yu works as a secondary school teacher since leaving university witnessing the changes and reform in school education. New ideas come and go. Most important is the target of education. Are students sensible enough to work hard in their studies? Who can influence them so that they make effort in their studies? If we accept the idea that they are tabulae rasae, education is very significant in shaping their future development. Family and school work cooperately to shape students’ development. </p>

      <h4>Mr. Ko Yu Wa </h4>
      <p>Since 2011, Mr. Ko has been teaching Liberal Studies at Broadways and in 2019, he has also started teaching history as well. In a society with constant demands for the usefulness of education, the functions of history can be more difficult to define than those of science and mathematics. However, historical studies can be very indispensable to shape the characters of students by “studying the relationship between the heaven and man, looking through the changes taken place from ancient to present times”, quoting from the Chinese historians Sima Qian. Above all, from the Greek historian Herodotus, “If one insisted on always being serious, and never allow himself a bit of fun and relaxation, he/she would go mad without knowing it.”</p>

      <h4>Mr. Ling, Kwok Ho</h4>
      <p>I have been teaching in Broadway since 2015. My main duty is to teach Integrated Humanities and Liberal Studies. I hope that students enable students to develop multiple perspectives on contemporary issues, help them become independent thinkers and develop a range of skills. In a modern and knowledge-based society like Hong Kong, there is a rapidly growing demand for life-long self-improvement. As a result, I got my master degree in the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I have been introduced to a variety of penetrating and yet competing perspectives for the analysis of social phenomena, which are particularly useful in the present rapidly changing society. </p>

      <h4>Ms. Mak, Ka Ying</h4>
      <p> Miss Mak has been serving at Delia Group of School for 12 years. She has even taught different subjects such as Liberal Studies, Citizenship and Social Development, Integrated Humanities and Chinese languages. Miss Mak love to be a teacherand hopes to provide the best teaching and learning environment to all the students in order to help them build up their positive attitude, values and personality which are important to them in the future. For the mindset of Miss Mak, being a teacher is not a simple job, since we are not making a product in the factory, on the other hand, we are trying to facilitate the students to find out who they are and what they should be. </p>

      <h4>Mr. Tsang, Pok Chuen </h4>
      <p>Mr. Tsang started teaching right after his graduation. He believes that every student can develop into a better person with proper guidance and support. He always wants to understand a student as an individual and appreciates every effort they make. He believes that a happy school life makes an effective learner. He tries to have more fun in class and provides students with more chances to express themselves. </p>

      <h4>Mr. Wong, Chau Wai  </h4>
      <p>As the Discipline Master in school more than 20 years, lots of impressive and amazing working experience throughout my life. First of all, earning the respect and caring from many students and their families which makes me feel proud to become one of the staffs in Broadway. Moreover, every single communication or contact with the students and their parent lead me to have better and deeper understanding the ethnic minority people lifestyle, customs, difficulties in their daily life and their view on their future prospect in HK. No matter how I myself should be the lucky guy to compare other teachers in HK who are not in Broadway. Thanks for everyone who support me throughout my career in Broadway. Promise to all you that I am doing my best to work on it.</p>

      <h4>Ms. Yiu, Wai Yi  </h4>
      <p>Ms. Yiu is a LS teacher and careers teacher in Delia Memorial School (Broadway). She loves to assist students to explore their inner strengths and plan their future career paths. She believes that everyone can be the leaders in different aspects. There must be more surprising boxes that are awaiting us to unfold in spite of the blocks hindering our path. She sincerely looks forward to the day that her students find the programme they like, or the occupation they enjoy, and that day they come back to Broadway to share their stories with her. </p>

      <h4>Ms. Bibi Ayesha  </h4>
      <p>Ms. Ayesha was one of the first graduates of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and she completed her education with a Postgraduate Certificate in Education while working full-time as a teacher. As the Chairperson of PTA, she believes that it is crucial to share her own personal journey and to be able to contribute her knowledge and skills when working with children and nurturing the future generation to be responsible, honest, loving, positive mind sets. She wishes to inspire her extraordinary journey especially from studying for an associate degree and being able to promote back to bachelor program degree. She would like to send a message to all her students that they should never hide their past as it is what makes them who they are today. As she believes that successful people are not gifted, no matter how long it takes them, they just work hard enough to succeed on purposes
